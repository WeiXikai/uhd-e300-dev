/*! \brief Provide access to a 'null block'.
 *
 * A 'null block' is a specific block, which comes with a couple
 * of features useful for testing:
 * - It can produce data at a given line rate, with a configurable
 *   packet size.
 * - It can be used to dump packets ("null sink", "bit bucket")
 *
 * This block also serves as an example of how to create your own
 * C++ classes to control your block. This class both has functions
 * that inherit from uhd::rfnoc::block_ctrl_base, as well as
 * functions that are specific to this block.
