\section b200_imgs Specify a Non-standard Image

UHD software will automatically select the USRP B2X0 images from the
installed images package. The image selection can be overridden with the
`fpga` and `fw` device address parameters.

Example device address string representations to specify non-standard
images:

    fpga=usrp_b200_fpga.bin

    -- OR --

    fw=usrp_b200_fw.hex

\section b200_mcr Changing the Master Clock Rate

The master clock rate feeds the RF frontends and the DSP chains. Users
may select non-default clock rates to acheive integer decimations or
interpolations in the DSP chains. The default master clock rate defaults
to 32 MHz, but can be set to any rate between 5 MHz and 61.44 MHz.

The user can set the master clock rate through the usrp API call
uhd::usrp::multi_usrp::set_master_clock_rate(), or the clock rate can be set through the
device arguments, which many applications take: :

    uhd_usrp_probe --args="master_clock_rate=52e6"

\section b200_fe RF Frontend Notes

The B200 features an integrated RF frontend.

\subsection b200_fe_tuning Frontend tuning

The RF frontend has individually tunable receive and transmit chains. On
the B200, there is one transmit and one receive RF frontend. On the
B210, both transmit and receive can be used in a MIMO configuration. For
the MIMO case, both receive frontends share the RX LO, and both transmit
frontends share the TX LO. Each LO is tunable between 50 MHz and 6 GHz.

\subsection b200_fe_gain Frontend gain

All frontends have individual analog gain controls. The receive
frontends have 73 dB of available gain; and the transmit frontends have
89.5 dB of available gain. Gain settings are application specific, but
it is recommended that users consider using at least half of the
available gain to get reasonable dynamic range.

TX LED indicators are on when transimitting data and off when no samples are
available to transmit.  RX LED indicators are on when sending samples to the
host and off when unable to do so.  This means that TX/RX activity LED
indicators will blink off in a temporary transmit underflow or receive overflow
condition, indicating that the host is not sending or receiving samples fast
enough.  The host will be notified of the condition and output a "U" or "O" as
well.
