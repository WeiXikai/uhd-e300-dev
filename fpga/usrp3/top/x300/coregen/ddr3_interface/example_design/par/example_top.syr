INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 15-bit shift register was found for signal <u_mig_7series_v1_8_memc_ui_top_axi/mem_intfc0/ddr_phy_top0/u_ddr_mc_phy_wrapper/u_ddr_mc_phy/mcGo_r_15> and currently occupies 15 logic cells (7 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
