2. SUPPORTED DEVICES

  The following device families are supported by the core for this release.
  
  2.1 ISE

    All 7 Series devices
    Zynq-7000 devices
    All Virtex-6 devices
    All Spartan-6 devices

  2.2 Vivado

    All 7 Series devices
    Zynq-7000 devices


3. NEW FEATURES  

   14.1 / 2012.1:
 
   -  Synchronous clock-domain crossings are performed completely within the clock converter module, 
      so multi-cycle clock constraints are no longer necessary and are no longer generated. 
      ACLK period parameter is used only for async clock conversions, and the async CDC clock constraints 
      will still succeed using a TIG, even if the ACLK period is not specified.
      
   -  Asynchronous clock-domain crossings are now performed using a single instance of 5-channel 
      AXI FIFO (per interface slot) instead of 5 separate calls to fifo_generator, thereby decreasing compilation time.
      Timing constraints for async CDC are now conditionally generated only if the interconnect instance performs any 
      async conversions.


4. RESOLVED ISSUES 

   14.4 / 2012.4:
 
   -  When using the Vivado implementation flow, the axi_interconnect core generates XDC timing constraints for each 
      asynchronous clock-domain crossing. Beginning in 14.4, these timing constraints are based on clock periods defined 
      in your system-level XDC (using create_clock). If a system-level clock definition is missing for the AXI ACLK pin 
      on either side of any async conversion, implementation will issue critical warnings.

5. KNOWN ISSUES 

   The following are known issues for v1.06.a of this core at time of release:
   
   - Setting parameter C_S_AXI_IS_INTERCONNECT = 1 is not supported.
   
   - The diagnostic control interface (S_AXI_CTRL) is not implemented. The parameter 
     C_USE_CTRL_PORT is therefore forced to 0.
